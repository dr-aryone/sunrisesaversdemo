# sunrisesaversdemo
Demo app "Sunrise Savers Club"

To run, do the following:

- clone this repo
- npm install && bower install
- node app.js
- grunt serve

This code is for demo purposes only, to demonstrate skills in responsive HTML and CSS as well as JavaScript. It uses a Node backend so that it can route API requests, but to avoid requiring the user to set up a database, it uses a session instead.
